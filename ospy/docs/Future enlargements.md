OSPy Future enlargements
====

### These enhancements will be included in OSPy in the future
This list serves developers as To-Do (a list of things that need to be done) - based on the ideas and requirements of users of the amazing OSPy system).

  * RF radio sensors  
small and cheap modules based on MCU and radio module (measurement of various quantities and transmission over a longer period of time. Mostly battery-powered)
  
  * LoRa RF sensors  
modules based on MCU and LoRa module (measurement of various quantities and transmission over a longer period of time. Mostly battery-powered. Advantage of long-distance information transmission - for example, corn fields)
  
  * ESP32-based multi-contact sensor  
add 7-button status transfer functionality to existing ESP32-based multisensors and then trigger various events.
  
  * ESP8266-based sensor on Sonof devices  
finally finish the program and API access for these devices
